**Sami Elsayed**, a senior at the **[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST)](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu)** is the sole researcher and developer of this project. With a strong passion in computer science and engineering, his academic journey has been deeply influenced by his fascination with technology and his dedication to solving complex problems.

## The project

This project is an exploration into improving the efficiency and performance of AI algorithms when run on heterogeneous systems using Linux. The research aims to optimize how different hardware components (such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs) are utilized together, ensuring effective resource management and enhanced performance.

The project began on August 2024 as part of the required senior research project at the school. Elsayed is enrolled in the Computer System Research class and had a focus and mission on optimzing processors and AI.

### Why this Project?

As AI continues to evolve and become more demanding, the need for efficient and effective utilization of diverse hardware resources is crucial. By focusing on Linux-based systems, which offer flexibility and robustness, this project aims to address these challenges and contribute valuable insights to the field.

### Goals and Objectives

- **Performance Optimization:** Enhance the execution speed and efficiency of AI workloads.
- **Resource Management:** Develop methods for better resource allocation and load balancing.
- **Integration:** Ensure compatibility and seamless operation across different hardware components.
- **Hardware Development:** A new type of processor incorperating the methods and ideas to develop something light and cheap.

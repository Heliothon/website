If you are reading this, that means you are interested in learning more about my project and about computer systems, how exciting!

I will try not repeating information again here, but this project is my high school senior research project based on my key interests in computer systems and engineering. Thank you for being part of this incredible journey.

I will be updating about my project here pretty regularly, but if you're looking for my research site where I have my **Codects** series and other research projects, [click here](https://selsayed25.github.io/research).
